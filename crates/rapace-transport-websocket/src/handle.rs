//! Handle + Driver implementation for WebSocket transport.
//!
//! TODO: This entire module is commented out during the API transition from TransportHandle
//! to the new Transport enum approach. It will need to be updated to work with the
//! new rapace-core API.
//!
//! The old implementation relied on TransportHandle, TransportDriver, and TransportParts
//! types that no longer exist in rapace-core. Once the new Transport enum is fully
//! implemented, this module should be rewritten to work with that API.
